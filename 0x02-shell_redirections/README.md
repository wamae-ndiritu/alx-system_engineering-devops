#I/O Redirection\n
#0: Hello World: A simple script file that displays "Hello, World"\n
#1: Confused smiley
To display `"(Ã”o)'` the way it is on the screen can be problematic. We need to use quotes as it is one string.
However, we'll have to use the `\`  character to signify that the double quotes after opening double quotes is not a special character.
##2: Let's display a file
`cat` command is used to display the content of a certain file
3. What about 2?
Displaying the content of 2 files simulatenously
4. Last lines of a file
`tail filename` can be used to get the last 10 lines of the file named `filename`
5. I'd prefer the first ones actually
Similary to `tail` command, we can also use `head` command to list the first 10 lines of a file.
6. Line #2
Listing a specific number of lines in a file can be done using the `head` or `tail` command with `-n [n]` option.
